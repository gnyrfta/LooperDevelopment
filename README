This is a fork of AudioTrackLooper. It is for testing different things. Right now it contains: 
* Record to wav file. 
* Change playdirection to backwards.
* Cumulative echo - feedback kind of - might not work right. 
* Echo placed on every different track that is not cumulative. Still working on this.
